# AP CSA Mini‑Project: Data Analysis with Arrays & File Input
### Using CSV Files • Arrays of Objects • Algorithms • Data Ethics & Quality

---

## 📌 Project Overview
In this mini‑project, you will choose a dataset (CSV file), design a **custom class** to represent each row, read the dataset using the **Scanner** class, store all data as **objects** in an ArrayList or array, and answer a **guiding question** by analyzing the data.

This project reinforces:

- Arrays & ArrayLists  
- File input with `Scanner`  
- Class design (attributes, constructors, methods)  
- Algorithms (min, max, average, filtering)  
- Data quality & ethics  
- Documentation using **Javadoc**  
- Creating a **UML class diagram**  

By the end, you will produce insights and answer your original question using your program.

---

## 🎯 Your Task
You will:

1. **Choose a dataset** (teacher provided or public).  
2. **Write a guiding question** for your dataset.  
3. **Design a Java class** with ≥ 3 attributes.  
4. **Use `Scanner` to read a CSV file**, parse rows, and construct objects.  
5. **Store all objects** in an array or ArrayList.  
6. **Analyze the dataset** using algorithms you create.  
7. **Print insights** and answer your guiding question.  
8. **Document your code** with Javadoc.  
9. **Create a UML class diagram** representing your custom class.  

Optional stretch challenges are included at the bottom!

---

## 🧪 Example Questions You Might Ask
Your dataset might allow you to answer things like:

- *"Which Pokémon type has the highest average Attack?"*  
- *"Which U.S. state had the lowest obesity rate in 2020?"*  
- *"What country had the highest CO₂ emissions in 2000?"*  
- *"What is the average HP for Fire-type Pokémon?"*  

Think simple, clear, and answerable.

## 📁 Project Structure
Your repository should follow this structure:
```
/src
    Main.java
    YourClass.java
/data
    your_dataset.csv
README.md   ← this file
UML_Diagram.png (or UML_Diagram.pdf)
```

---

## 🧩 Step 1 — Choose Your Dataset

**Dataset Name:**  StateData2020-CDC-Census
**Source / Link:**  https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome2/external/_static/datasets/StateData2020-CDC-Census.csv

**What this dataset contains (2–3 sentences):**  
States, population, non=insured %, firearms deaths, drug overdose deaths, and URL for state info

---

## ❓ Step 2 — Write Your Guiding Question

Your guiding question should be something you can answer using your dataset.

**My guiding question:**    
What state has the greatest drug overdose deaths total?
What state has a drug overdose death rate over 25%?


Examples:

- "Which Pokémon has the highest HP?"  
- "What is the average life expectancy in this dataset?"  
- "Which state had the highest vaccination rate?"  

---

## 🧱 Step 3 — Design Your Class

You must create a class that represents **one row** of your dataset.

### ✔ Your class must include:

- **At least 3 private attributes**  
- **A constructor** that takes all attributes as parameters  
- **Getter methods** for attributes you plan to analyze  
- **`toString()`** for easy printing  
- Any additional analysis/helper methods as needed  

### ✏ Include your class diagram


---

## 📥 Step 4 — Read Your CSV File Using Scanner

In `Main.java`, you must:

- Create a `File` object  
- Use `Scanner` to read the file  
- Skip the header row (if needed)  
- Read each line  
- Split by commas using `.split(",")`  
- Trim whitespace  
- Parse numbers using `Integer.parseInt()` or `Double.parseDouble()`  
- Construct objects  
- Add them to an ArrayList or array  

### Column → Attribute Map

| Attribute Name      | CSV Column Name                   | Column Index # |Notes                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
|state                |STATE                              |0               |Name of state or territory  |
|population           |Population in 2016 from census.gov |1               |Used for scaling analysis   |
|overdoseDeathRate    |Drug Overdose death rates...       |5               |Rate per 100,000 population |
|drugOverdoseDeaths   |Drug overdose deaths total         |6               |Absolute count of deaths    |

---

## 📊 Step 5 — Analyze Your Data

You must write **at least two algorithms** to analyze your dataset.

### Required: Choose 2 or more algorithms
- [ ] Minimum value of attribute  
- [X] Maximum value of attribute  
- [ ] Average of attribute  
- [ ] Filter by category  
- [X] Count items matching a condition  

**Algorithms I will implement:**

1. findStateMaxOverdoseDeath  
2. findStatesOver25  

Optional extras:  
- Sorting  
- Top/bottom N items  
- Grouping by category  
- Comparison between groups  

---

## 🧠 Step 6 — Insights & Answer to Your Question

After analyzing your objects, print:

- ✔ How many rows were loaded  
- ✔ Your algorithm results  
- ✔ A clear answer to your guiding question  

**My findings:**  
Maximum Deaths: Florida recorded the highest total with 4,728 drug overdose deaths.

High-Rate States: 13 regions (including West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) have death rates significantly higher than the national average (over 25 per 100k).

**My answer to the guiding question:**  
The state with the highest total drug overdose deaths is Florida. The states with a rate over 25 per 100,0000 are Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia.

## 📝 Step 7 — Documentation Requirements

### ✔ Javadoc Comments
You MUST use Javadoc for:

- Every **class**  
- Every **method**  
- Every **parameter**  
- Every **return value**  

Example:
```java
/**
 * Returns the highest HP among all Pokémon.
 * @param list the ArrayList of Pokémon objects
 * @return highest HP value in the dataset
 */
public static int findMaxHP(ArrayList<Pokemon> list) {
    // implementation
}
```

### ✔ UML Class Diagram
Add a UML diagram showing:

- Class name
- Attributes
- Methods
- Visibility (private/public)

Save as `UML_Diagram.png` or `.pdf` in the repo.

---

## 🛡 Step 8 — Data Ethics & Quality Reflection
Write a short reflection (3–5 sentences):

- What data-quality issues did you find?
- Could your dataset be biased?
- How might incomplete or inaccurate data affect results?
- How trustworthy are your insights?

**My reflection:**  
During the analysis, I discovered that Puerto Rico has a value of -1 for its death totals and rates, indicating missing or suppressed data. This could lead to incorrect averages if not handled properly. Furthermore, the dataset uses 2016 data; using this to make policy decisions in 2024 could be biased as the opioid crisis has shifted geographically. Finally, total death counts are heavily biased by population size, which is why the "Rate per 100,000" is a more ethical and accurate metric for comparing the severity of the crisis between states like California and Rhode Island.
